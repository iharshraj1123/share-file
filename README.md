Simply share files between computers in a LAN, or through tunnelling, or simply hosting on some server.

You can share the whole folder, but it works only for PCs not phones.

# How to Use

- Share.php = index.php, its the front end for the app.

- Requirements: PHP, MySQL, php.ini setup so server can access C:/ and D:/ drives using "/c:/" and "/d:/".

- Copy paste the sql in sharefile.sql.

**When you are on the host PC (the pc on which server is hosted, url contains localhost).**

- In File sharing mode, Click on browse, copy paste the local address of the folder that contains the files you want to share. eg, "D:/games/". Then select all those files. Hit upload.

- Make shortcuts for your frequent places using the buttons.

- In Folder sharing mode, your folders will be converted into zip files.

**When you are on Some PC on the network**

- Simply upload the files/folders, no need to copy paste addresses.
